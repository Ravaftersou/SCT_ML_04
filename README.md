# SCT_ML_04
Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This project implements a hand gesture recognition system that can accurately detect and classify different hand gestures from both images and video streams. It uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to enable gesture-based control systems and intuitive human-computer interaction.

🚀 Features

Real-time gesture recognition

Works with both image and video inputs

Built with OpenCV and Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch)

Easily extendable for custom gestures

Applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and smart devices
